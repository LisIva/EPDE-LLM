Given the input data and the exploration buffer, let's start by suggesting a simpler equation that involves the second derivative with respect to \( x \) (\( \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \)). We will then gradually move to more complex equations if needed. 

Here is a new equation to explore:

### Equation Suggestion
\[ \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \]

This equation is simple and directly involves the second derivative with respect to \( x \), which has not been explored yet in the `exp_buffer`.

### Python Function Implementation
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation
- **right_side**: The right-hand side of the equation is simply \( c[0] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \).
- **string_form_of_the_equation**: This is the string representation of the equation, which matches the format required.
- **len_of_params**: The number of parameters used in the equation is 1.

### Next Steps
- If the score from this equation is high, we can explore more complex interactions, such as involving \( u \), \( \frac{du}{dt} \), \( \frac{du}{dx} \), or higher-order interactions.
- For example, we might try \( \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c[1] \cdot u \) or \( \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c[1] \cdot \frac{du}{dt} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \).

Feel free to evaluate this equation using the provided `evaluate` function and let me know the score. Based on the score, we can decide whether to explore further.
