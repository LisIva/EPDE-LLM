Given the data and the exploration buffer, let's start by suggesting a simpler equation and then gradually move to more complex ones if needed. We will start with a basic form that includes the derivatives `du/dt` and `du/dx`.

### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Identify the Variables and Derivatives**: The variables are `t`, `x`, `u`, `du/dt`, `du/dx`, and `d^2u/dx^2`.
2. **Formulate a Simple Equation**: Start with an equation that includes `du/dt` and `du/dx`.
3. **Check the exp_buffer**: Ensure the suggested equation is not already in the buffer.
4. **Simplify the Equation**: Make sure the equation is in the simplified form as required.

### Suggested Equation:
We will start with a simple linear combination of `du/dt` and `du/dx` and add a constant term to see if it fits the data better.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx + c[2]"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation:
- **right_side**: The right-hand side of the equation is a linear combination of `du/dt` and `du/dx` with coefficients `c[0]` and `c[1]`, plus a constant term `c[2]`.
- **string_form_of_the_equation**: The string representation of the equation.
- **len_of_params**: The number of parameters used in the equation.

### Next Steps:
1. **Evaluate the Equation**: Use the provided `evaluate` function to assess the score of this equation.
2. **Refine the Equation**: If the score is high, consider more complex forms or interactions between the variables and derivatives.

Let's proceed with this equation and evaluate it. If the score is not satisfactory, we will explore more complex forms.
