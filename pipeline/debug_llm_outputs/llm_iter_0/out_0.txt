Given the input data, it appears that the second derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( t \) (\( \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} \)) has a strong relationship with the first derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( x \) (\( \frac{du}{dx} \)). Therefore, a simple linear relationship can be a good starting point for the equation. Let's construct the equation in the form:

\[ \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

Here is the Python function `equation_v1` that implements this relationship:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function takes the time \( t \), position \( x \), the function value \( u \), a dictionary of derivatives `derivs_dict`, and a parameter array `params`. It returns the right-hand side of the equation, a string representation of the equation, and the number of parameters used.
