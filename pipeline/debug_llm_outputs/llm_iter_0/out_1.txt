Given the input data and the exploration buffer, we can start by exploring a simpler form of the equation that involves the derivatives. The provided buffer already contains the equation `d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx` with a score of 1000, which indicates it is not a good fit. We should try a different structure that includes other derivatives or terms.

Let's start by exploring an equation that involves `du/dt` and `du/dx`. This approach might capture more complex interactions between the derivatives and the function `u`.

Here is a suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a linear combination of the first derivatives `du/dt` and `du/dx`, which might better capture the dynamics in the data. The parameters `c[0]` and `c[1]` will be optimized to minimize the loss function.

Let's evaluate this equation to see how well it fits the data.
