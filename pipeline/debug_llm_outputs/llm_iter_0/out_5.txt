Given the input data and the exploration buffer, we can infer that the equation \( \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} \) is likely to involve some combination of the first and second derivatives with respect to \( x \) and possibly \( t \). We've already seen simpler linear combinations of these derivatives, so let's try a slightly more complex interaction involving higher-order terms and products of derivatives.

One possible equation to explore is:
\[ \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2 + c[1] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \]

This equation includes a quadratic term of the first derivative with respect to \( x \) and a term involving the second derivative with respect to \( x \). It also ensures that the equation is dependent on at least one derivative.

Here is the Python function implementing this equation:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2) + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation has not been tried before according to the `exp_buffer`, and it explores a new interaction between the derivatives. Let's see how it performs!
