Given the provided data and the exploration buffer, let's start by constructing a new equation that is dependent on at least one derivative and explores potential interactions between the input variables. Since the current buffer suggests that simpler linear combinations of derivatives and constants have been tried, we can explore a slightly more complex interaction involving the product of `du/dx` and `u`.

We will construct the equation:

\[ \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \cdot u \]

This equation introduces a non-linear interaction between `du/dx` and `u`.

Here is the Python code for this new equation:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx * u"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

# Example usage:
# Assuming you have your data and derivs_dict properly set up
# data = {'inputs': (t, x, u), 'derivs_dict': derivs_dict}
# score = evaluate(data)
```

This equation is not present in the `exp_buffer` and introduces a new interaction that might help capture the dynamics of the system better. Let's see how well it performs when evaluated with the given data.
